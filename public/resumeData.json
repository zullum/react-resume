    "bio": "Hi there! I am Sanel! Iâ€™m a 35 year old web/software developer. As a software developer I like to try and learn new technologies in my constant strive to advance. Currently employed and working in a team environment at a company called Cape Ann Enterprises in Bosnia for the last 6 years. I can be a leader, when necessary, but can also be an equal player on the team if the job calls for it. I tend to do well in a team setting because I can relate to others well, be a good listener,  have a professional demeanor, and understand what it takes to get the job done. I can help delegate tasks, compromise, and fulfill any role on the team that is needed. I am flexible in working independently or on a team, as needed by the task at hand.",
